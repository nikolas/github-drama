# [github-drama](https://github.com/nikolas/github-drama)

This is a curated collection of "dramatic" github interactions.

## Contributing to github-drama

This repo is intended to point out comical interactions that come up in the world of
software development, and not to harass anyone or hurt their feelings. Sometimes
tensions build up in online interactions, and the intention of github-drama is to allow
participants to take a step back from the "drama" and say to themselves, "phew,
I need to chill".

### How do I find drama?
Go into a GitHub project's issues, and sort by "Most commented" or "Most reactions".

### What qualifies as drama?
There's no agreement on what's considered dramatic enough to be included
in github-drama. Everyone has a different sense of humor. There are plenty
of "non-serious" github threads, where the usual github politeness gave
way to reaction gifs and one-word replies, turning into something like a
4chan thread but less funny.

This repository follows the guideline that if anyone in the thread appears to
be getting worked up about something, it can be considered for inclusion here.
If a repository's maintainer has locked conversation on a thread, that's also
a good indicator that it could be included here.
